## Claude Code Git Workflow

**File**: [claude.md/git.md](claude.md/git.md)

Automated git workflow for feature development with branch creation, commit/PR automation, and message generation.

**Example usage**:

- "start feature: add user authentication" → creates and checks out `add-user-authentication` branch
- "finish feature" → stages changes, drafts commit/PR messages for approval, then commits and creates PR
